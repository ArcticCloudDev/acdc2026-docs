# ACDC Minecraft Controls Cheat Sheet

This guide covers the essential controls for playing in the ACDC Minecraft World.

## Keyboard and Mouse Controls

If you're new to gaming or PC gameplay, using both hands at the same time might feel unfamiliar. However, this method significantly enhances gameplay quality.

**Left Hand Positioning:** Place your left hand on the WASD keys. These keys control your movement within the game - think of them as controlling your player's legs.

**Right Hand Positioning:** Use your right hand for the mouse or trackpad, managing actions like looking around, selecting, and interacting - think of them as controlling your player's head or eyes.

## Touchscreen Controls

For those using touchscreen devices, the controls are intuitive with on-screen icons indicating possible player actions. This interface, along with taps and long holds on the screen, dictates interaction with the in-game world.

## 💡 TOP TIP!

Minecraft doesn't have an "undo" button. If a block is misplaced or destroyed, it must be manually replaced. It can be frustrating at first but it is all part of the learning process, we promise!
