## Hackathon Rule Book

Scoring is built around two types of recognition:

- **Collectible badges**: Claimed by teams and awarded by judges
- **Judging categories**: Ranked by judges, with points awarded based on the final rankings at the end of the hackathon

---

### 1. Collectible badges

- Collectible badges are available to be claimed by teams across all three days.
- In addition to the core set of collectible badges, there are also occasional Head2Head/Sponsor challenge badges that are announced during the hackathon with details on how to qualify. These collectible badges are claimed in the same way as the core badges; however, they may have special rules such as it is only awarded to the first team to claim it.
- Each collectible badge has an assigned judge responsible for reviewing claims.
- Teams must claim a badge to be considered.
- Each claim must include a link to a blog post explaining why the team should be awarded the badge.
- The assigned judge reviews the claim and either:
  - Awards the badge, or
  - Declines the badge with comments.
- If declined, the team may submit a new claim after addressing the feedback.
- Once awarded, a badge cannot be claimed again by the same team.

**Collectible badge points:**

- Most collectible badges are worth **10 points**.
- The **Dooh badge** is worth **-10 points**. It is fully expected that every team claims this badge unless they claim and can testify to the judges that they have never made a mistake.

The intent is that all teams should earn all collectible badges. These points reward engagement and learning but are not intended to be the most significant influence on the final outcome.

---

### 2. Judging categories

There are **six judging categories**, each with **one assigned judge**.

For each category:

- The assigned judge is responsible for ranking teams at the end of **each day**.
- A team is only ranked if it has demonstrable work in that category.
- If a team has done nothing in a category, it does not receive a rank.
- Daily rankings are used to determine the top team in each category for that day.
- At the *end* of Day 1 and Day 2, **only** the top-ranked team in each category receives that day's **category badge** and is awarded 10 points.
- The ranking position of each team in each category is then visible to all teams to view.

---

### 3. Final category judging and scoring

At the end of **Day 3**, final judging is performed:

- Each judge produces a final ranked list for their category.
- Only teams included in the final ranking receive category points.
- Category points are calculated as:

CategoryPoints = 100 − (Rank − 1) × (100 / N)

*Where:*

- **Rank** is the team's final position in the category
- **N** is the number of teams that received a rank in that category

- Teams that do not receive a rank earn **no points** for that category.

---

### 4. Winning Team

The team with the most total points from both collectible badges and category points is the winner of the hackathon.
