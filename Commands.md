# ACDC Minecraft Commands Reference

## Command Structure

All commands use the `acdc:` prefix (e.g., `acdc:menu`, `acdc:team`).

> **Note:** The `acdc:` prefix is only required if the command name conflicts with another addon's commands. If there are no conflicts, you can omit it (e.g., just use `menu` instead of `acdc:menu`).
